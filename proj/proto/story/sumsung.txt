< You choose `dangerous explosive`

You choose `dangerous explosive`.

But it does not seem to be dangerous. Is it really explosive?

.It is as big as your hand. It is black and smooth and covered by glass.

#于是你问店主：“这真的是炸药吗？要怎么用呢？”
So you ask the storekeeper:"Is it really explosive? How do I use this?"

#店主：“这其实是一种叫做‘智能手机’的精密仪器。而你手上拿的东西，是这仪器的残次品。这个叫‘三星智能手机’。”
Storekeeper: "Actually, this is called 'sumsung mobile phone', which is one kind of mobile phone..."

#你：“等等，我有点听不懂……‘智能手机’又是什么？”
You: "wait a minute, I've kind of mess... What is 'mobile phone'?" 

#店主：“是一种多功能的，靠电力驱动的精密仪器。因此，这个要配合‘充电器’使用。充电器是免费送你的……”
Storekeeper: "A mobile phone is a multi-functional equipment that drived by electronic... (Describing...)"

.(A Few Minutes Later...)

#你：“原来如此。也就是说，一旦有了这东西，我就相当于既买了地图，又买了报纸，还买了炸药。想让他爆炸，就得把他扔进火堆里。太实惠了！谢谢你店主！”
.You: "I see. That is to say, if I have this, I will have map, newspaper, compass, explosive, and all I need!
.     "That is cool! Thank you!"

#店主：“不客气。”
Storekeeper: "You are welcome."
#你身上只剩一块钱了。

#你离开了商店，向着森林走去。因为森林是从村庄到魔王城的必经之地。
.You leave the store and go to the forest,
.because you have to walk through the forest,
to arrive the living place of the man of the evil.

#你打开了手机里的“指南针”应用程序，这样你就不用担心迷路了。
You open the "Compass" app on your sumsung so you don't have to worry about getting lost.

#忽然，你听见前面传来了哥布林的笑声。
Suddenly, you heard the laughter of Goblin coming in front of you.

#你遇到敌人了。大概是一群哥布林。
You meet enemies. Probably a group of Goblin.

#你小心翼翼地潜伏在树丛里，缓缓地、悄悄地向前移动。你看到，前面有四五只哥布林坐在huodui前烤火。
.You cautiously lurk in the bushes, moving slowly and quietly forward.
You see that four or five goblins are warming themselves by a fire.

.You choose:
.
.    1 - Throw sumsung into fire
.    2 - Google goblin's weakness
