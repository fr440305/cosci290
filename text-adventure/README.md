# Text Adventure

## Play it

If bash is supported:

<pre>
$ ./x.sh
</pre>

Else:

<pre>
$ javac \*.java
$ java Main
</pre>

## Requirements that does not strictly satisfied

- A strong storyline (for groups 2&3&4 that is outlined in a text file and read using file I/O)

My story is poor.

- A multidimensional array that acts as a map.

I use `HashMap`, is that Ok?
